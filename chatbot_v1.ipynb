      "First, let's look at the part of the problem that says \"20 / 4\".  What does the \"/\" symbol mean?  Can you remember what we do when we see that symbol in a math problem? Think about sharing things equally.  If you have 20 cookies and you want to share them equally among 4 friends, how many cookies does each friend get?\n",
